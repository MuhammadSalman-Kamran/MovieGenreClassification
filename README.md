# Movie Genre Classification for Textual Data
![Alt](https://github.com/MuhammadSalman-Kamran/MovieGenreClassification/blob/main/dataset-cover.jpg)

## Overview

This project is aimed at genre classification for textual data, a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval. The goal is to automatically categorize textual content into specific genres or categories, which can have various applications, such as content recommendation, information retrieval, and content organization.

## Data

The project leverages a dataset containing text descriptions and associated genres. The dataset was preprocessed to clean the text, remove unnecessary information, and convert it into a format suitable for machine learning. The cleaned descriptions were then transformed into numerical feature vectors using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique, which is widely used for NLP tasks.

## Models

Four different machine learning models were employed for genre classification:

- **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, particularly useful for text classification tasks.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A powerful linear classifier capable of handling high-dimensional data.
- **Logistic Regression**: A linear model for classification tasks.

These models were trained and evaluated to determine their effectiveness in classifying text descriptions into genres.

## Results

The project's results include the predictions for the test dataset using each of the models mentioned above. The accuracy scores and other relevant metrics can help assess the performance of these models.

## Usage

You can use the provided code and pre-trained models to perform genre classification on your own text data. The README file contains instructions for running the code and using the models.

Feel free to explore the project's Jupyter Notebook to dive deeper into the code, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.

## Contribution

Contributions and suggestions are welcome. If you have ideas for improvements or wish to collaborate on enhancing the genre classification models, please submit a pull request or open an issue.
